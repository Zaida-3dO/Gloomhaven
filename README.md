- You arrive at the building marked on the map, but it's been recently burnt down.
- You search the charred rubble and find a set of stairs leading down to a stone cellar where you hear chanting similar to the one you heard on the ship.
- Their chanting causes 4 massive rune-covered stones to scatter across the room as the floor begins to shake and the the ceiling starts to crumble.
